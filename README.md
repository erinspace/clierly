# What is clie/r.ly? 

Clie/r.ly is a natural language processor for terms of service agreements. Our goal was to take an abitrary terms of service document and to produce a markup that would help people filter through these masses of text that most people never read. 

Clie/r.ly was born at the HackVirginia hackathon in Novemeber of 2013.
